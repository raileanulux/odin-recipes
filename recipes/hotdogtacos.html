        <p>Never heard of tacos de Soto? Neither had I—and I practically have a PhD in tacos. As a Mexican-American professor who teaches classes about Mexican food, I’m a bit of a taco “expert” in some sense. But I had never heard of this borderlands taco before my mother, Anna Alvarez, suggested it. The taco de Soto is a fried, crispy taco filled with sliced hot dog and cheese. While on the surface it seems humble enough, this taco has a cultural significance that is deeply personal for some; for others, it’s a snack with nostalgic memories attached. </p>
        <h2>These are the ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hot dog franks</li>
            <li>12 small corn tortillas</li>
            <li>12 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Shredded lettuce and salsa, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>These are the steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice hot dogs lengthwise into quarters. In each tortilla, arrange a slice of cheese and a hot dog and fold tortilla over to enclose. </li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil; there shouldn’t be too much oil, but enough to cover folded tacos.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Holding folded tortilla by the edges with tongs, gradually introducing half of taco into oil. The tortilla will begin to brown as it crisps. As it takes shape, let go of taco and fry until golden brown, about 10 seconds. Turn and fry until second side is golden brown, about 15 seconds.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with paper towels. Repeat with remaining tacos. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Fill tacos with lettuce. Serve with salsa alongside.</li>
        </ol>
