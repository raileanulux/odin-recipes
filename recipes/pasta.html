        <h2>These are the ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>12 oz. orecchiette</li>
            <li>1/3 c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>5 c. cherry tomatoes, halved (about 1 1/2 lb. total)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, plus more for garnish </li>
            <li>1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 c. finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh basil leaves, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>These are the steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente, usually 2 to 3 minutes less than package instructions. Reserve 1 c. pasta water and drain pasta.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large straight-sided skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and light golden, about 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until paste is brick-red, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and ¾ tsp. salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are tender and starting to burst, about 5 minutes</li>
            <br>
            <li>Increase heat to high and add vinegar and sugar. Bring to a boil and cook 1 minute. Add pasta, Parmesan, and ½ c. reserved pasta water. Cook, stirring, until sauce thickens and coats pasta, about 2 minutes more. Add more reserved pasta water by the tbsp., if necessary, to thin sauce so it coats pasta.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Divide pasta among bowls. Top with Parmesan, red pepper flakes, and basil.</li>
        </ol>
